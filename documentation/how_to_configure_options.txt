Here are some suggestions on how to familiarize yourself with the various options that uncrustify offers.

1. Read through default.cfg [^1] config file. This lists all the available options and a brief description of what they do.
2. Create an empty config file or make a copy of the default.cfg file
3. Looking at the file default.cfg, add or change one or more options in the config file created in 2. and test the result.
4. Iterate step 3. over and over changing just a few options at a time till the required output is reached. Working on one option at a time will give the best results.

It is recommended to use a backup-update-compare cycle to ease your testing.

1. save a copy of the last configuration and the last output
2. modify the config file
3. run uncrustify again on the original unmodified files with the new configuration
4. compare the new output with the saved one to see the effects of the changed configuration.
