This file describes the purpose of the 'dump steps' command line option.


OVERVIEW
--------
The '-ds/--dump-steps' option instructs uncrustify to log a lot of debug information
throughout the formatting process, which can be very useful when trying to understand
why something is being formatted in the way it is. This is usually the case when the
expected results do not match with the actual ones.


COMPARISON WITH '-p' OPTION
---------------------------
While the '-p' option only prints the parsing information at the end of the process,
the '-ds' option will print the same information at many points in time, providing
extra depth to users and developers when troubleshooting an issue.


GENERATED FILES
---------------
Add '-ds FILE' to the command line options to enable the functionality.
This will create a number of files as follow:

- FILE_000.log:   this file contains the list of the options used by uncrustify
- FILE_001.log:   this file lists the parsing status after uncrustify has read the input file
                  and before starting the formatting process.
- FILE_002.log:   this file lists the parsing status before uncrustify enters its first internal
                  while loop
- FILE_AAA.log - FILE_BBB.log: a variable number of files, depending on the progress of the
                  formatting process. Each file is printed at the end of one iteration of the
								  first internal while loop.
- FILE_BBB+1.log: this file lists the parsing status before uncrustify enters its second internal
                  while loop
- FILE_BBB+2.log - FILE_CCC.log: a variable number of files, depending on the progress of the
                  formatting process. Each file is printed at the end of one iteration of the
								  second internal while loop.
- FILE_CCC+1.log: this file lists the parsing status at the end of the process.

NOTE: by combining FILE_000.log and FILE_CCC+1.log, you will get the same content of the parsing
      file obtained with the '-p' option.


USAGE
-----
Comparing each file with the previous one will help understanding why something is being formatted
the way it is. When debugging a formatting issue, this provides a quick way to restrict the
section of the code that should be investigated.

The first line of each file contains a brief descriptive string which can be used to quickly find the
point in the code where the file was created. Look for 'dump_step(dump_file, <descriptive string>)' in
src/uncrustify.cpp.
